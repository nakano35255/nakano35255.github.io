## News

**November 12th, 2024:** Our paper on the theoretical study of spontaneous symmetry breaking observed in general laminar flows has been published in J. Stat. Mech. This is a joint work with Yuki Minami from Gifu University. ([Link to the paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/ad83c9/meta))

**November 7th, 2024:** We have uploaded a paper on molecular dynamics simulation of long-range correlations under a temperature gradient to arXiv. ([Link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04416))

**September 3rd, 2024:** Our paper on the long-range spatial correlations commonly observed in the disordered phase of active matter with anisotropic self-propulsion has been published in Physical Review Research. This is the second publication from our active matter research project with Kyosuke Adachi from RIKEN iTHEMS/BDR. ([Link to the paper](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.033234))

**January 19th, 2024:** Our paper, which provides a detailed investigation of the many-body phenomena in active Brownian particles with anisotropic self-propulsion, has been published in Physical Review Research. This is the first publication from our active matter research project with Kyosuke Adachi from RIKEN iTHEMS/BDR.

## Research Interests (For the list of publications, "click [here](/publications-en/)")

I am exploring intriguing non-equilibrium phenomena that occur in many-particle systems governed by classical mechanics. 

My research utilizes large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics.
